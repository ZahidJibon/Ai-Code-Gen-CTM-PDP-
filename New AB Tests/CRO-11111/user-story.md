### Test Analysis:
## üß™ Test Summary
**üóÇ Target Page:** PDP (Product Detail Page)
**üåê Targeting Type:** Global JS
**‚úÖ Global JS Required:** Yes
* * *
## üîß Implementation Details
*   **Targeting:** Run only on **PDP pages** via Global JS.
*   **Widget:**
    *   Build a **new video widget** using **static HTML + CSS + JS**.
    *   The widget will pull the **‚ÄúLook, see, feel‚Äù videos** currently displayed inside the **product gallery**.
    *   Videos will be displayed in a dedicated widget section (outside of the gallery).
*   **HTML:**
    *   Create a container with heading (e.g., `"Look, See, Feel"`).
    *   Embed video thumbnails or players pulled from existing gallery sources.
*   **CSS:**
    *   Style to match provided figma / design guide.
    *   Ensure **responsiveness** (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **JS:**
    *   Extract video sources (URLs) from the gallery.
    *   Dynamically insert them into the new widget container.
    *   Handle **play/pause** correctly without breaking gallery functionality.
* * *
## üéØ Functionality
*   Ensure all **Look, see, feel videos** appear correctly in the new widget.
*   Ensure videos still **play properly** in both gallery and widget.
*   Ensure no duplication or breaking of the gallery navigation.
*   Ensure CTA buttons (‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù, ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù, etc.) remain functional.
*   Ensure no conflicts with existing JS (lazy-load, slider, etc.).
* * *
## ‚úÖ QA Checklist
*   Video widget renders on PDP pages only.
*   All ‚ÄúLook, see, feel‚Äù videos load correctly.
*   Videos can be played/paused properly.
*   The original gallery continues working as intended.
*   Layout/styling matches design and is responsive.
*   No console errors introduced.
*   All PDP functionality (ATC, quantity selector, variants, etc.) works properly.

### Logic & Rules
* * *

1. Currently, CTM displays product videos in their gallery. This product video has a CSS class of "product-video"
    1. We need to extract this product video to display in the widget
2. This will run on mobile and desktop
3. The explanatory video needs to be added to a widget and a pop-up
4. **This should only run on tile products with explainer videos**
    1. **The "product-video" class can be checked to see if the video exists on the page**
5. They will be on auto-play.
6. If a user closes the widget. It should not display on that page. IF they navigate to a different product, it should display for the new product.
